# GCP Kubernetes Cluster Incident Response Plan

## 1. Incident Detection & Initial Assessment

### Monitoring Systems
- Primary: Cloud Monitoring (formerly Stackdriver)
- Secondary: Prometheus/Grafana dashboards
- Alert channels: PagerDuty, Slack (#incidents channel)

### Initial Assessment Checklist
1. Acknowledge alert in incident management system
2. Access GCP Console and verify cluster status
3. Check cluster metrics: CPU, memory, network utilization
4. Review recent changes via Cloud Audit Logs
5. Determine incident severity (P1-P4)

## 2. Initial Response Actions

### For Node Issues
1. Check node status: `kubectl get nodes`
2. Review node logs: `kubectl describe node <node-name>`
3. Verify node pool auto-scaling settings
4. Check for pending pods: `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep Pending`

### For Pod/Application Issues
1. Check pod status: `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`
2. Review pod logs: `kubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace>`
3. Check pod events: `kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>`
4. Verify deployment configurations

### For Networking Issues
1. Verify Services and Ingress configurations
2. Check Cloud Load Balancer health
3. Review Network Policy configurations
4. Verify VPC and subnet settings

## 3. Escalation Protocol

### P1 (Critical) - Complete Service Outage
- Immediate escalation to Site Reliability Engineering team
- Notify: Development Team Lead, Infrastructure Manager, CTO
- Status updates every 30 minutes

### P2 (High) - Partial Service Degradation
- Escalate to SRE team if not resolved in 30 minutes
- Notify: Development Team Lead, Infrastructure Manager
- Status updates every hour

### P3/P4 (Medium/Low) - Minor Issues
- Handle within team
- Escalate if not resolved within SLA
- Document in incident tracking system

## 4. Communication Plan

### Internal Communication
- Primary: Slack #incidents channel
- Secondary: Email distribution list
- Update incident status page every 30 minutes
- Maintain incident command in Slack thread

### External Communication
- Customer Support team handles external communications
- Use prepared templates for status page updates
- Coordinate messaging with PR team for major incidents

## 5. Recovery Actions

### Immediate Recovery Options
1. Scale out node pool
2. Roll back recent deployments
3. Restart affected services
4. Failover to backup region (if applicable)

### Post-Recovery Verification
1. Verify service health metrics
2. Run end-to-end tests
3. Check error rates and latency
4. Verify data consistency

## 6. Post-Incident Actions

### Documentation Requirements
1. Detailed timeline of events
2. Actions taken and their outcomes
3. Root cause analysis
4. Impact assessment
5. Prevention recommendations

### Follow-up Tasks
1. Schedule post-mortem meeting within 48 hours
2. Update runbooks based on lessons learned
3. Create JIRA tickets for identified improvements
4. Review and update monitoring thresholds
5. Schedule preventive maintenance if needed
