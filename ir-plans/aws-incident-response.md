# AWS 3-Tier Architecture Incident Response Plan

## 1. Architecture Overview
- Presentation Tier: ALB + EC2/ECS in Auto Scaling Group
- Application Tier: EC2/ECS + Auto Scaling Group
- Data Tier: RDS Multi-AZ + Read Replicas

## 2. Incident Detection & Initial Assessment

### Monitoring Systems
- Primary: AWS CloudWatch
- Secondary: AWS X-Ray, DataDog
- Alert channels: PagerDuty, Slack (#aws-incidents)

### Initial Assessment Checklist
1. Check AWS Health Dashboard
2. Review CloudWatch Alarms status
3. Verify affected tier and components
4. Access AWS Console and verify service health
5. Determine incident severity (P1-P4)

## 3. Tier-Specific Response Actions

### Presentation Tier Issues
1. Check ALB health checks and target group status
2. Verify Auto Scaling Group metrics and capacity
3. Review Security Group and NACL configurations
4. Check Route 53 health checks and DNS resolution
5. Monitor CloudFront distribution status (if used)

### Application Tier Issues
1. Review EC2/ECS instance health metrics
2. Check application logs in CloudWatch Logs
3. Verify Auto Scaling Group behavior
4. Review recent deployments via AWS CodeDeploy
5. Check IAM roles and permissions

### Data Tier Issues
1. Monitor RDS performance metrics
2. Check RDS event logs and error logs
3. Verify replication status and lag
4. Review backup status and latest snapshot
5. Check for storage capacity issues

## 4. Escalation Protocol

### P1 (Critical) - Complete Service Outage
- Immediate escalation to DevOps/SRE team
- Page on-call Database Administrator for RDS issues
- Notify: Engineering Manager, CTO, AWS Support
- Updates every 15 minutes

### P2 (High) - Significant Degradation
- Escalate to relevant tier owner
- Notify: Engineering Lead, DevOps Manager
- Updates every 30 minutes

### P3/P4 (Medium/Low)
- Handle within operations team
- Escalate if not resolved within 2 hours
- Document in incident management system

## 5. Recovery Procedures

### Immediate Actions
1. Scale compute resources if needed
2. Failover to standby RDS instance
3. Roll back recent deployments
4. Switch DNS to backup region
5. Restore from latest snapshot

### Service Recovery Verification
1. Run health check scripts
2. Verify all tier connectivity
3. Check error rates and latency
4. Confirm data consistency
5. Test critical user flows

## 6. Communication Plan

### Internal Updates
- Use Slack #aws-incidents channel
- Update status page every 30 minutes
- Send email updates to stakeholders
- Maintain incident timeline

### External Communication
- Customer Support handles client communications
- Use prepared status page templates
- Coordinate with PR for major incidents

## 7. Post-Incident Requirements

### Documentation
1. Incident timeline and actions taken
2. Root cause analysis (RCA)
3. Service impact assessment
4. Mitigation steps implemented
5. Preventive measures identified

### Follow-up Actions
1. Conduct post-mortem within 24 hours
2. Update monitoring thresholds
3. Review and update runbooks
4. Create backlog items for improvements
5. Schedule preventive maintenance
