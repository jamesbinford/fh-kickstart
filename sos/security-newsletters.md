## "Your Password is Like Your Toothbrush..."
...share it with no one and change it every three months!

Did you know that 81% of data breaches involve weak or stolen passwords? Here's how to be part of the solution, not the problem:

### ðŸŽ¯ The Three Golden Rules of IAM
1. Use a password manager - Your brain isn't secure storage
2. Enable MFA everywhere - It's like wearing both a belt AND suspenders
3. Never reuse passwords - When one service is compromised, they all are

### ðŸ‘‰ Quick Tip
Test your password strength at haveibeenpwned.com. If it appears even once, change it immediately!

### ðŸ’¡ Think About It
If you use the same password for both your work and personal Netflix account, a breach at Netflix could give attackers access to our company's systems. Scary, right?
